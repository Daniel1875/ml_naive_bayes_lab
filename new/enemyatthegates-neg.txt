It's the Battle of Stalingrad . Things are not going well for the Red Army . The film suggests that should they loose this battle they will also loose the war . But the soldiers and the officers only know defeat , they have no hope of victory .

Enter a political commas ( Fiennes ) who has witnessed superb shooting by the soldier Zaitsev ( Law ) - killing a bunch of German officers taking a shower very near the front line ( sic! ) . Zaitsev is turned into a sniper and his exploits are front page news all over the Soviet Union . He and his comrades are so successful that the German army ceases to function properly , only a few hundred meters away from the river Volga and Victory .

This is the setting for this movie , and the sniper duel that follows between Zaitsev and his German counterpart Konig ( Ed Harris ) is good entertainment . The love affair between Zaitsev and the female soldier Tania ( Weisz ) does not add to the suspense , but is forgivable . Some people like romance in movies , and why not ? It does not make the story any better though .

Some people seem to believe that this movie is historically mostly accurate . That is not correct . There was a battle in Stalingrad . It was a bloody mess . Zaitsev was a good sniper and he killed a lot of Germans . Almost everything else in this movie is fiction and / or unrealistic . It is impossible to get every detail right , but in this movie the main plot - the duel between Zaitsev and Konig - is pure fiction and Soviet propaganda . And the idea that Zaitsev sort of " won the battle " is also absurd . He was part of their delaying forces in the city . Operation Uranus - a pincer move with tanks - was what really won the battle .

Enjoy the movie if you like . The acting is good , the scenery and costumes are OK , visual effects mostly OK . Just do not think you are learning history or are seeing realistic military tactics .
