First , I'll agree that the filmmakers got a lot of details right : The timing of the U.S . attacks when the Japanese were caught in the rearming process . The poor performance of the Devastator TBD . Faulty torpedoes . The politics of the Japanese military . The fast turn-around getting Yorktown out to sea again . And lots more .

But the errors , embellishments and omissions were glaring : The Marshal Islands attack was ridiculously inflated . The Kamikaze hit on Enterprise during that battle ( complete with Nick Jonas saving the day ) never took place . The complete absence of American fighter planes on the American carriers . American attackers going in and facing anti aircraft fire without having first been jumped by Zeroes , and the missing dogfights via F4F fighter escorts . SBDs blowing Zeros out of the sky . Taking the time to depict John Ford as a brave movie maker on Midway , yet not showing Marine Fighter Squadron 221 , flying antiquated equipment , going out to meet the incoming Japanese attackers against overwhelming odds and pretty much getting slaughtered . Yorktown's involvement in the battle reduced to one scene where she is burning , depicted from afar . The Nautilus getting depth-charged U-571 style . The ships in both fleets in such tight formations , it's more like a photo op than a battle formation .

So many worthwhile details that could have been made right in the same screening length , if they would have simply ditched the goofy Doolittle sequence . I love Aaron Eckhart , great actor , but his scenes in China had no place in a movie called "Midway," if the price was cutting out major elements of the Midway battle .

Maybe I'm being picky , but when they go out of their way to glorify John Ford , while leaving out a squadron of Marine fighter pilots that sacrificed themselves so valiantly , it just strikes me as typical Hollywood b.s.
