This is an excellent historical portrayal of the Battle of Midway , and some of the events that led up to it . There is a lot of intensity throughout the film , and it shows how some of the decisions on both sides were truly a gamble in that time . There were no satellites , gps systems , or sophisticated radar systems . The only missing pieces to this movie , as noted by others , is the lack of US fighter planes . Maybe it is intended to focus mainly on the Dauntless pilots . I took my wife and kids to see this movie , as it seems much of the history of this country is being forgotten . I am so glad I did . The kids had no idea that any of this happened . As for the critics that wrote negative reviews and trashed this movie , I think attributes to a lot of what is wrong with this country today . People who decided not to see this movie , on Veterans Day weekend , based on the critics reviews , are truly missing an excellent movie . This movie is historically accurate , with no lame love story , or fictional substories .
